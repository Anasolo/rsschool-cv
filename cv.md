# Summary

I am a very motivated self-taught programmer (Yes, I already call myself a programmer, so I'm bringing it to the reality)üòá. Even though it has been very hard for me to start learning totally new thing by myself, I did not give up and this is the reason why I am so sure, that I'll do anything to achieve my goalsü•á. My future plans are so bright and charming, that I can't wait to be a successful Web Developer ü•∞. I've always imagined my job to be interesting, not boring and monotonous. What I like in being a programmer is that, I know, one day I'll be able to work and travel at the same time, so my life will be filled with happy moments, joy and also with a job I like to do.
